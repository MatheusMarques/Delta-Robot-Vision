Re-pulled original ofxKinect example because I couldn't revert the generated pointcloud of the working git.  
The pointcloud was drawn inversely and was a bit fucked.

21 June:  Merged playtime branch
	- Determined high point thresholds
	- Limited ofPoints returned for optimisation
	- TODO:  make thresholds for high points adjustable
	- TODO:  incorporate mutlitouch.framework
	- TODO:  add pointOfInterest selection via mouse click for determining 'highpoint'

20 June:  TODO

	- Calibrate threshold values and adjust the floor and ceiling values dynamically
	- Map these values to blob detection
	- Enable blob detection
	- Accurately measure distance in real measurement units (m)


Have added the following to project:

	- normalizeOfPoint(x, w, y, h, z, d):  w, h, d are upper thresholds. All low thresh's are 0.0f
	- HighestZ: gets and sets the closest point to the camera as highestZ
		- used to find the highest point and range tolerance based on this point
	- tolerance:  normal between 0.0f and 1.0f.  Affects upperLimit && lowerLimit by exactly tolerance * 0.5
